### **🎯 ARM Cross-Compilation Debugging (Your Main Focus)**

#### **Quick ARM Debug Commands:**
```powershell
# Test ARM cross-compilation locally
act workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -j cross-compile

# Test specific strategies manually
cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --features raspberry-pi
cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --features with-rppal,picam
cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --no-default-features
```

> **Note**: Local ARM cross-compilation testing with `act` requires Docker Desktop running with Linux containers and an elevated shell (run PowerShell as Administrator) on Windows. Ensure the Docker daemon is active and accessible via `docker ps`. If Docker isn't available or cannot connect, you may skip local cross-compile tests or validate on GitHub-hosted runners.

#### **ARM Build Strategies (In Order of Preference):**
1. **🎯 Strategy 1: Full Features** - `--features raspberry-pi`
   - Includes: OpenCV + GPIO + Camera
   - Status: May fail due to OpenCV cross-compilation
   - Success: ✅ Ready for production

2. **🔧 Strategy 2: GPIO Features** - `--features with-rppal,picam`
   - Includes: GPIO + Camera (no OpenCV)
   - Status: Should succeed in most cases
   - Success: ✅ Ready for field deployment

3. **⚡ Strategy 3: Core Only** - `--no-default-features`
   - Includes: Basic functionality
   - Status: Should always succeed
   - Success: ✅ Core functionality verified

4. **🚀 Strategy 4: Minimal** - `--no-default-features --features with-rppal`
   - Includes: Basic GPIO only
   - Status: Fallback option
   - Success: ✅ Hardware interface working

#### **What Each ARM Strategy Result Means:**

**✅ Strategy 1 Success**: 
- **Excellent!** Full ARM build with OpenCV works
- Ready for production deployment
- All features available

**✅ Strategy 2 Success**:
- **Good!** ARM build with GPIO and camera works
- Can deploy for field testing
- Add OpenCV later if needed

**✅ Strategy 3 Success**:
- **Acceptable!** Core ARM functionality works
- Can add features incrementally
- Hardware compatibility confirmed

**✅ Strategy 4 Success**:
- **Basic!** Minimal ARM support works
- Foundation is solid
- Build up features step by step

**❌ All Strategies Fail**:
- **Issue!** Fundamental cross-compilation problem
- Check cross-rs installation
- Verify target toolchain installation

#### **ARM Cross-Compilation Status Monitoring:**
- Watch for "🎯 Starting ARM cross-compilation" messages
- Look for "✅ SUCCESS" indicators
- Check which strategy succeeded
- Monitor build output for specific errors
