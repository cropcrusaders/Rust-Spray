# GitHub Actions Extension Quick Reference

## 🚀 **Quick Commands**

| Action | Command | Shortcut |
|--------|---------|----------|
| View Workflow Runs | `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "GitHub Actions: View Workflow Runs" | |
| Trigger Workflow | `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "GitHub Actions: Trigger Workflow" | |
| View Logs | Click on workflow run in extension panel | |
| Rerun Failed | `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "GitHub Actions: Rerun Workflow" | |

## 📊 **Status Indicators**

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ Green checkmark | Workflow passed |
| ❌ Red X | Workflow failed |
| 🟡 Yellow circle | Workflow in progress |
| ⏸️ Gray | Workflow canceled/skipped |

## 🔍 **Debugging Workflow**

### 1. **Identify Issues**
- Open `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Look for red squiggly lines (syntax errors)
- Check extension panel for failed runs

### 2. **View Detailed Logs**
- Click on failed workflow in extension
- Navigate to failing step
- Look for error messages and stack traces

### 3. **Test Fixes**
- Edit workflow file with IntelliSense
- Use `workflow_dispatch` for manual testing
- Monitor results in real-time

## 🛠️ **Current Rust-Spray Fixes Applied**

### ✅ **Workflow Improvements**
1. **Added Debug Information** - Environment details for troubleshooting
2. **Better Error Handling** - Continue on ARM cross-compilation failures
3. **Enhanced Build Logic** - Clear error messages for expected failures
4. **Modern Actions** - Updated to non-deprecated actions
5. **Native Test Job** - Verify basic functionality works

### ⚠️ **Expected Results**
- **Native x86_64 builds**: ✅ Should succeed
- **ARM cross-compilation**: ❌ Expected to fail due to OpenCV
- **Workflow syntax**: ✅ Should validate correctly
- **Artifact uploads**: ✅ Should work for debugging

## 📝 **Monitoring Next Steps**

1. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with better debugging"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Watch Extension**
   - Monitor status bar for workflow updates
   - Check extension panel for run details
   - View logs for any unexpected failures

3. **Validate Results**
   - Native builds should succeed
   - ARM builds should fail gracefully with clear messages
   - Artifacts should be uploaded for analysis

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Using the GitHub Actions extension, you should see:

1. **Workflow Validation** ✅
   - No syntax errors in `.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Proper schema validation

2. **Build Status** ✅/⚠️
   - Native test job: Green checkmark
   - ARM cross-compilation: Red X (expected due to OpenCV)

3. **Clear Error Messages** ✅
   - Descriptive failure reasons
   - Links to documentation explaining issues

4. **Artifact Generation** ✅
   - Native binary uploaded
   - Debug information available

The GitHub Actions extension will be your primary tool for monitoring these improvements and catching any future issues!
