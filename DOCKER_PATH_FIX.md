# Docker Rust Installation Fix for Cross-Compilation

## Issue
The Docker build was failing with "cargo: not found" error during cross-compilation. Multiple attempts to fix the PATH didn't work because the cross-rs images don't have Rust pre-installed as expected.

## Root Cause
The cross-rs Docker images are designed to be used with the `cross` CLI tool, which handles the Rust installation differently. The images don't have cargo/rustc available by default in the container.

## Solution Applied
Install Rust directly in the Docker images using rustup:

### Files Fixed:
- `Dockerfile.armv7-opencv` 
- `Dockerfile.cross-aarch64`

### Changes Made:
```dockerfile
# Install Rust toolchain for building
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
RUN cargo --version && rustc --version
```

## Verification
Added explicit cargo and rustc version checks to ensure installation works.

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Cross-compilation Docker builds should now work correctly with Rust properly installed.

The previous errors:
```
#12 0.142 /bin/sh: 1: cargo: not found
```

Should now be resolved with the explicit Rust installation.
