Cross CLI Installation

The cross crate is no longer published on crates.io. Install it directly from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/cross-rs/cross.

You may optionally lock to a tagged release such as v0.2.6 or v0.2.7. Using the default branch works as well.

In your CI job, run a cargo install command with the --git option before any cross build commands.

Remember that the Docker image tag does not need to match the CLI commit. They are independent.
