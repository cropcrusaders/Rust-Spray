**You're now equipped with the same debugging tools used by professional DevOps engineers!** 🎉

## 🛠️ **Debugging Steps**

### Step 1: Analyze Current Job Status
**What to look for in the `test-native` job:**

1. **Checkout Step** - Should be ✅ green
2. **Install Rust Toolchain** - Should be ✅ green  
3. **Run Tests** - Check for any test failures
4. **Build Native** - Look for compilation errors
5. **Upload Artifacts** - Verify completion

### Step 2: Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Issue: Test Failures**
**Symptoms:** Red ❌ on "Run tests" step
**Debug Actions:**
```bash
# Look for these error patterns in logs:
- "test result: FAILED"
- "assertion failed"
- "panicked at"
```

**Solution:** Tests might be failing due to missing dependencies or configuration

#### **Issue: Build Failures**
**Symptoms:** Red ❌ on "Build native" step
**Debug Actions:**
```bash
# Look for these error patterns:
- "error[E0xxx]:" (Rust compilation errors)
- "linking with `cc` failed"
- "could not find"
```

**Solution:** Dependencies or feature flags might be misconfigured

#### **Issue: Missing Dependencies**
**Symptoms:** Errors during dependency installation
**Debug Actions:**
```bash
# Look for:
- "package not found"
- "failed to resolve"
- "error: could not compile"
```

### Step 3: Specific Rust-Spray Debug Actions

#### **Check Feature Flags**
The native build should work without cross-compilation issues:
```yaml
# In our workflow, native builds use default features
cargo test --verbose
cargo build --release --verbose
```

#### **Look for OpenCV Issues**
Even in native builds, OpenCV might cause issues:
```bash
# Error patterns to look for:
- "Failed to find installed OpenCV package"
- "pkg-config exited with status code 1"
- "opencv4.pc needs to be installed"
```

## 🚨 **Quick Debug Commands**

### Using GitHub Actions Extension:

1. **Navigate to Failed Step:**
   - Click on any red ❌ step in the left panel
   - Scroll through the logs to find error messages

2. **Check All Steps:**
   - Look at each step's status (✅ green, ❌ red, 🟡 yellow)
   - Focus on the first failed step

3. **Compare with ARM Jobs:**
   - Switch to the ARM cross-compilation jobs
   - Compare error patterns

### Key Log Sections to Check:

1. **Error Summary** (usually at the bottom of failed steps)
2. **Cargo Output** (detailed compilation information)
3. **Test Results** (specific test failures)
4. **Environment Info** (our debug output)

## 🔧 **Immediate Actions**

### Action 1: Identify the Failure Point
**In the extension panel, look for:**
- Which step has the red ❌?
- What's the last successful green ✅ step?
- Any yellow ⚠️ warnings?

### Action 2: Analyze Error Messages
**Common Rust-Spray specific errors:**

```bash
# Dependency Issues:
error: failed to run custom build command for `opencv v0.94.4`

# Feature Flag Issues:  
error[E0432]: unresolved import `opencv`

# Cross-compilation Issues (shouldn't happen in native):
error: linking with `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` failed
```

### Action 3: Check Our Debug Output
**Look for our custom debug section:**
```bash
=== Build Information ===
Target: (should be x86_64 for native)
Features: (should show enabled features)
Runner OS: (should be Linux)
=== Rust Toolchain ===
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## 🎯 **Expected vs Actual Results**

### **Native Job Should:**
✅ Checkout code successfully
✅ Install Rust toolchain
✅ Run tests (may have some warnings)
✅ Build release binary
✅ Upload artifact

### **If Native Job Fails:**
This indicates a fundamental issue that needs fixing:
- Dependency problems
- Feature flag conflicts  
- Test failures
- Code compilation errors

## 🚀 **Next Steps Based on Results**

### If Tests Fail:
1. Check test output for specific failing tests
2. Look for missing test dependencies
3. Check if tests require special setup

### If Build Fails:
1. Analyze Rust compilation errors
2. Check Cargo.toml dependencies
3. Verify feature flag configuration

### If Both Pass:
1. Check ARM cross-compilation jobs
2. Look for expected OpenCV failures
3. Verify artifacts were uploaded

## 📝 **Reporting Issues**

**Use this template to describe what you're seeing:**

```
Job: test-native
Step: [which step is failing]
Error: [main error message]
Status: [✅/❌/🟡]
Pattern: [what type of error it looks like]
```

Let me know what specific errors or patterns you're seeing in the logs, and I'll provide targeted debugging solutions!
