## üö® **Common Problems and Solutions**

### Problem 1: Cross-Compilation Failures
**Symptoms:** ARM builds failing with OpenCV errors
**Solution:** Use the extension to monitor these specific workflow runs

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/build.yml
- name: Cross compile for ARM
  run: cross build --release --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --features with-rppal
  continue-on-error: true  # Allow failure for known OpenCV issue
```

### Problem 2: Workflow Syntax Errors
**Symptoms:** Red squiggly lines in workflow files
**Solution:** The extension highlights syntax errors inline

### Problem 3: Failed Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Workflow fails during dependency installation
**Solution:** Check workflow logs via the extension

## üîß **Debugging Workflow with Extension**

### 1. **Identify Failed Workflows**
```bash
# Use the extension to view recent workflow runs
# Look for red X indicators next to workflow names
```

### 2. **View Detailed Logs**
- Click on failed workflow in the extension
- Navigate directly to the failing step
- Analyze error messages and stack traces

### 3. **Make Fixes in Real-Time**

2. **Cross-Compilation Setup** - Updated in `Cross.toml`
3. **Feature Flags** - Implemented in `Cargo.toml`
4. **Workflow Simplification** - Cleaned up `.github/workflows/build.yml`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Expected Failures**
1. **ARM Cross-Compilation with OpenCV** - This will fail until OpenCV is properly configured for cross-compilation
2. **Native ARM Builds** - May fail without proper cross-compilation environment

### üéØ **Using Extension to Monitor Fixes**

1. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Updated workflow configurations"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor via Extension**
   - Watch for new workflow runs in the extension
   - Check status in VS Code status bar
   - View logs for any remaining issues

3. **Iterate on Fixes**
   - Use extension feedback to refine solutions
   - Test different configurations
   - Monitor success rates

## ÔøΩ **Current Rust-Spray Workflow Issues and Fixes**

### Issue 1: OpenCV Cross-Compilation Failure
**Problem:** ARM builds fail when trying to link OpenCV
**GitHub Actions Extension Shows:** Red X on ARM build jobs
**Fix:** Use the extension to monitor this specific fix:

```yaml
# Update build.yml matrix to handle OpenCV properly
matrix:
  include:
    - target: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
      arch: arm64
      features: with-rppal
      opencv: false  # Disable OpenCV for cross-compilation
    - target: armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
      arch: armv7
      features: with-rppal
      opencv: false  # Disable OpenCV for cross-compilation
```

### Issue 2: Missing continue-on-error in Matrix
**Problem:** Entire workflow fails if one target fails
**Fix:** Add proper error handling:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false  # ‚úÖ Already present
  matrix:
    include:
      - target: armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
        arch: armv7
        features: with-rppal
        continue-on-error: true  # ‚ö†Ô∏è This should be at job level
```

### Issue 3: Release Asset Upload API Deprecation
**Problem:** `upload-release-asset@v1` is deprecated
**Fix:** Update to newer action:

```yaml
# Replace deprecated action
- name: Upload Debian package
  if: github.event_name == 'release'
  uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1  # ‚ùå Deprecated
  # Should be:
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1  # ‚úÖ Current
```

## üîß **Step-by-Step Workflow Fixes Using GitHub Actions Extension**

### Step 1: Monitor Current Workflow Status
1. Open VS Code with GitHub Actions extension
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "GitHub Actions: View Workflow Runs"
3. Look for failed runs (red X icons)
4. Click on failed run to see detailed logs

Using the extension's IntelliSense, update `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build and Release

permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: read

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch:  # ‚úÖ Allows manual triggering via extension

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - target: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
            arch: arm64
            features: with-rppal
          - target: armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
            arch: armv7
            features: with-rppal
    
    # Add continue-on-error at job level
    continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.target == 'armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf' }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Rust toolchain
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          targets: ${{ matrix.target }}

      - name: Install cross CLI

      - name: Build (with OpenCV error handling)
        env:
          PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS: "1"
          CARGO_INCREMENTAL: "0"
        run: |
          # Try building with features, fall back without OpenCV if it fails
          cross build --release --target ${{ matrix.target }} --features ${{ matrix.features }} --verbose || \
          cross build --release --target ${{ matrix.target }} --features ${{ matrix.features }},no-default-features --verbose

      - name: Upload artifact
        if: success() || failure()  # Upload even if build partially failed
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: rustspray-${{ matrix.arch }}
          path: target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/rustspray
```

### Step 3: Add Debugging Information
Add debug steps to help diagnose issues:

```yaml
      - name: Debug Environment
        run: |
          echo "=== Environment Information ==="
          echo "Target: ${{ matrix.target }}"
          echo "Features: ${{ matrix.features }}"
          echo "Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
          echo "=== Rust Information ==="
          rustc --version
          cargo --version
          cross --version
          echo "=== Available Targets ==="
          rustup target list --installed
